Architecture Decisions
CSS Architecture
Problem: Maintaining consistent styling across components Solution: CSS custom properties for theming with modular stylesheets Rationale: Enables easy theme changes and reduces CSS redundancy

Animation Strategy
Problem: Performance issues with scroll-based animations Solution: Intersection Observer API with class-based animation system Rationale: Better performance than scroll listeners and more maintainable than inline animations

JavaScript Organization
Problem: Code organization and maintainability Solution: Modular approach with separate files for core functionality and animations Rationale: Separation of concerns and easier debugging/maintenance

Design System
Problem: Consistent visual identity and developer experience Solution: Comprehensive CSS variable system with semantic naming Rationale: Easier maintenance, theme switching capabilities, and consistent spacing/colorsS
